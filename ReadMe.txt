Spatial Interpolation with Natural Breaks:

The coordinate of the interpolated point is given in the code. 
The unknowns points are stored in the "data.txt".

The figures are shown:
"Original Vonoronoi.png";
"New Vonoronoi.png": known points with the interpolated point;
"Voronoi_finite_polygon.png": show the finite vonoronoi points.
